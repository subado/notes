Python references use a modified **Backusâ€“Naur form (BNF)** grammar notation.

**Rule** begins with a name (which is the name defined by the rule) and `::=`.

| Char                | Meaning                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\|`                | separating alternatives                                       |
| `*`                 | zero or more repetitions of the preceding item                |
| `+`                 | one or more repetitions of the preceding item                 |
| `[]`                | the item enclosed in brackets is optional                     |
| `()`                | grouping                                                      |
| `""`                | the item enclosed in "" is a string literal                   |
| `(char1)...(char2)` | all characters between from char1 to char2 in the ASCII table |
| `<...>`             | informal description of the symbol defined                    |

A **lexical definition** operates on the individual characters of the input source.

A **syntax definition** operates on the stream of tokens generated by the lexical analysis.
